        <h1>Privacy Policy for Morning Mindful</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 21, 2026 | <strong>App Version:</strong> 1.0.27</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Morning Mindful ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
        <p>Morning Mindful stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Journal entries:</strong> Your written journal content, including text, timestamps, mood selections, and attached photos</li>
            <li><strong>Photo attachments:</strong> Images you attach to journal entries, stored locally on your device in app-private storage</li>
            <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Your preferences such as blocking duration, word count requirements, morning window times, and selected apps to block</li>
            <li><strong>Usage statistics:</strong> Entry counts, word counts, and streaks (stored locally for your personal tracking)</li>
            <li><strong>Backup files:</strong> Encrypted backup files (including photos) stored in a folder you choose (if auto-backup is enabled)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> All data is stored exclusively on your device using encrypted storage. We do not have access to your journal entries or personal data.
        </div>

        <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or transmit your journal entries to any server</li>
            <li>We do not collect personal identification information</li>
            <li>We do not track your location</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal files</li>
            <li>We do not sell or share any data with third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>

        <h3>Accessibility Service</h3>
        <p>Morning Mindful uses Android's Accessibility Service to detect when you open apps that you've chosen to block during your morning mindfulness period. This permission is used <strong>solely</strong> to redirect you to your journal when blocked apps are opened.</p>
        <p><strong>We do not:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read or collect any content from other apps</li>
            <li>Log which apps you use</li>
            <li>Transmit any accessibility data off your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage Stats Access (Gentle Reminder Mode)</h3>
        <p>If you choose Gentle Reminder mode, Morning Mindful requests access to Usage Stats. This permission allows the app to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect which app is currently in the foreground</li>
            <li>Determine when you open a blocked app so we can show a reminder overlay</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We do not:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or store your app usage history</li>
            <li>Track how long you use other apps</li>
            <li>Transmit any usage data off your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This permission is only used in real-time to detect blocked apps and is never logged or shared.</p>

        <h3>Display Over Other Apps</h3>
        <p>This permission allows the app to show the journal screen or reminder overlay when you attempt to open a blocked app.</p>

        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>Used for two purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing a notification when app blocking is active, allowing you to track your remaining time</li>
            <li>Sending optional daily reminder notifications at a time you choose to encourage your journaling habit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Boot Completed & Exact Alarms</h3>
        <p>Used to restart the blocking service and reschedule daily reminders after your device reboots. Without this, blocking and reminders would stop working until you manually open the app.</p>

        <h3>Foreground Service</h3>
        <p>Used to keep the blocking monitor running reliably in the background during your configured morning window. This is what allows the app to detect blocked apps even when Morning Mindful is not in the foreground.</p>

        <h3>Advertising ID</h3>
        <p>Used by Google AdMob to serve ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device's Google settings, or reset your advertising ID at any time.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>Morning Mindful displays advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect certain information for ad personalization. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how Google handles data.</p>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device's Google settings.</p>

        <h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used in aggregate (e.g., which features are popular, how often the app is opened). This service collects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous usage events (e.g., "journal saved", "settings changed")</li>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version, screen size)</li>
            <li>App version and session duration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No personal data, journal content, or mood selections are included in analytics events. All events are anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.</p>

        <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and improve app stability. This service collects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
            <li>Crash logs and stack traces</li>
            <li>App state at the time of crash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No personal data or journal content is included in crash reports.</p>

        <h3>Firebase Performance Monitoring</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase Performance Monitoring to track app performance and identify slow operations. This service collects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App startup time</li>
            <li>Network request latency</li>
            <li>Screen rendering performance</li>
            <li>Device and OS information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data helps us optimize the app experience. No personal data or journal content is included in performance reports.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>All locally stored data is encrypted using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SQLCipher for database encryption (AES-256)</li>
            <li>Android Keystore-backed EncryptedSharedPreferences for settings and encryption keys</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your journal entries and settings are protected with industry-standard encryption and cannot be accessed by other apps or by us.</p>

        <h2>Data Backup</h2>
        <p>Morning Mindful provides two backup options to protect your journals:</p>

        <h3>Auto-Backup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatically saves your journals to a local folder you choose during setup</li>
            <li>Backups are created automatically every time you save a journal entry</li>
            <li>Encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a password you set</li>
            <li>Backups remain on your device in your chosen folder - we never have access</li>
            <li>You must remember your password to restore after reinstalling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Manual Export/Import</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Export all journals to an encrypted .mmbackup file anytime</li>
            <li>Backups are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a password you choose</li>
            <li>We never see your backup password or data</li>
            <li>Backups are stored wherever you choose (Google Drive, local storage, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>All data remains on your device until you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall the app</li>
            <li>Clear the app's data through Android settings</li>
            <li>Delete entries within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not retain any of your data on external servers.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Morning Mindful is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
