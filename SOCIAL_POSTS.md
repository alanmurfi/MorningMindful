# Morning Mindful - Social Media Launch Posts

## Reddit Posts

### r/androidapps (Best for discovery)

**Title:** I built a free journaling app that blocks social media until you write - would love feedback

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I just launched my app **Morning Mindful** on Google Play.

**The Problem:** I kept waking up and immediately doom-scrolling Instagram/TikTok. By the time I stopped, an hour had passed and I felt awful.

**The Solution:** Morning Mindful redirects you to journal when you try to open blocked apps in the morning. Write a few thoughts, and you're free to scroll guilt-free.

**Features:**
- 📝 Simple journaling with photo attachments
- 🚫 Blocks 15+ social/entertainment apps
- 🌅 Configurable morning window (default 5AM-10AM)
- 🔒 Encrypted journal (SQLCipher) - your thoughts stay private
- 📊 Streak tracking
- 🌙 Dark mode + Material You colors
- 🌍 English, German, Chinese support

**Two blocking modes:**
- **Full Block**: Must complete journal to access apps
- **Gentle Reminder**: Shows reminder, lets you snooze

Free on Google Play, no subscriptions, just a small banner ad.

Would love feedback on:
- Is the blocking too aggressive or not enough?
- What features would you want?
- Any bugs you encounter

### r/digitalminimalism

**Title:** Built an app to break my morning phone addiction - and it actually worked

**Body:**
I used to lose 1-2 hours every morning to social media before even getting out of bed. Screen Time limits didn't work - I'd just dismiss them.

So I built Morning Mindful. Instead of blocking apps entirely (which felt restrictive), it redirects you to a simple journal. Write a few sentences about your thoughts, gratitude, or plans for the day, and the block lifts.

The idea is friction, not restriction. You CAN still use your apps — you just have to write a bit first. It turns that automatic phone-grab into something useful.

After 2 weeks of using it myself:
- Morning screen time down ~70%
- I actually remember what I wrote about being grateful for
- My mornings feel way less chaotic

It's free on Google Play. Would love feedback from this community.

### r/productivity

**Title:** How I replaced morning doom-scrolling with journaling (built an app for it)

**Body:**
Sharing something that actually changed my mornings:

**Before:** Wake up → grab phone → 45 min on Instagram → feel guilty → rush to get ready

**After:** Wake up → grab phone → app redirects me → 5 min journaling → get on with my day

I built **Morning Mindful** because I couldn't stop doing the first thing. It detects when you open social media apps during morning hours and redirects you to journal first. Not a hard block — just a nudge.

The point isn't to never use social media. It's to **not let the algorithm decide how your day starts**.

Free on Play Store if anyone wants to try it.

### r/journaling

**Title:** Made an app that turns your morning phone habit into a journaling habit

**Body:**
Fellow journalers! I wanted to share an app I built that might help those who struggle with consistency.

**Morning Mindful** intercepts your social media apps in the morning and prompts you to journal first. The idea is to use your existing phone habit (grabbing it first thing) and redirect it toward something meaningful.

Features:
- Clean, simple journal interface
- Photo attachments
- Daily prompts (random)
- Mood tracking
- Streak counter
- Encrypted entries (your thoughts stay private)
- Export/backup to folder

It's helped me journal every single day for the past month - when before I'd write maybe twice a week.

Free on Google Play. Would love to hear what features journalers would want!

### Problem/Solution Tweet
I was losing 1+ hour every morning to social media before even getting out of bed.

So I built an app that redirects Instagram/TikTok/Twitter to a journal.

5 min of writing → apps unlock → morning saved.

## Product Hunt (Save for later - needs more traction first)

**Tagline:** Block social media until you journal

**Description:**
Morning Mindful blocks your social media apps until you write a short journal entry. Instead of doom-scrolling first thing, you spend 5 minutes writing, then go about your day guilt-free.

**Key Features:**
- 🚫 Blocks 15+ social/entertainment apps during morning hours
- 📝 Simple, distraction-free journaling
- 🔒 SQLCipher encrypted database
- 📸 Photo attachments with timeline view
- 😊 Mood tracking
- 🔥 Streak tracking
- 🌙 Dark mode + Material You
- 📤 Export & backup

**Makers Comment:**
I built this because Screen Time limits weren't working for me — I'd just dismiss them every time. So instead of blocking apps completely, Morning Mindful redirects you. You end up journaling instead of scrolling, and after a while it just becomes the new habit.

## LinkedIn (Professional angle)

I used to start every workday by "quickly checking" Instagram. 45 minutes later I'd finally open my laptop, already behind and stressed.

So I built Morning Mindful. Now when I reach for social media before work, the app redirects me to a simple journal.

Writing for 5 minutes before emails has honestly changed the shape of my mornings:
- I actually know what my priorities are before 9am
- Way less of that scattered, reactive feeling
- I have a running log of things I'm grateful for (which felt corny at first but I'm into it now)

Free on Play Store if you're dealing with the same thing.
