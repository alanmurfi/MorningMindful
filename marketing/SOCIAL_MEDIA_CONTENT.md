🧵 I built an app to solve my own problem: I was doom-scrolling before my feet hit the floor every morning.

Morning Mindful blocks your social apps until you write a short journal entry.

Here's what it does and why I made it 👇

1/ The problem: Most of us grab our phones within seconds of waking up. We scroll for 30 mins before we even get out of bed. It sets a reactive, anxious tone for the whole day.

2/ The solution: A simple barrier. Before you can open Instagram, TikTok, or X—you write 50 words. That's it. Takes 2-3 minutes.

3/ Why it works: You're not fighting willpower. The app does the work. You just show up and write whatever's on your mind.

4/ Privacy first: Your journal is encrypted (AES-256) and never leaves your device. I literally cannot read your entries even if I wanted to.

5/ After 30 days, you'll have:
- 30 journal entries
- 1,500+ words of reflection
- A new morning habit
- Less phone anxiety

**Single Post Variations:**

```
The first 10 minutes of your day shapes the next 10 hours.

I built @MorningMindful to help you start with intention, not Instagram.

Block social apps → Write 50 words → Unlock your day.

```
POV: You reach for your phone at 6am

❌ Old you: Opens TikTok, 45 mins gone
✅ New you: Writes 3 sentences, apps unlock, day starts with clarity

Morning Mindful makes the new you automatic.

```
"I'll just check my phone real quick"

*45 minutes later*

If this is you every morning, I built something that might help. Morning Mindful blocks social apps until you journal—just 50 words.

No willpower needed. Just a system.

**Launch Post:**
```
I used to start every day the same way: lying in bed, doom-scrolling through social media before I even got up.

Sound familiar?

After trying countless "digital detox" methods that required willpower I didn't have at 6am, I decided to build a solution.

Morning Mindful is a simple Android app that blocks social media apps until you write a short journal entry (default: 50 words, about 2 minutes).

The key insight: Don't fight the urge to grab your phone. Just redirect what happens when you do.

Here's what makes it different:

🔒 Privacy-first: All data encrypted and stored locally. No accounts. No cloud.

⚡ Frictionless: Opens automatically when you try to use blocked apps

📊 Builds habits: Track your streak and watch your journal grow

🎯 Flexible: Choose which apps to block, set your morning window, adjust word count

After using it myself for months, I've written more journal entries than in the previous 5 years combined.

If you're struggling with morning screen time, I'd love for you to try it.

What does your morning phone routine look like? I'm curious if this resonates.

The average person checks their phone within 10 minutes of waking up—usually opening social media first.

I was definitely that person. Until I built something to help.

Title: I built an app that blocks social media until you journal (feedback wanted)

Hey everyone,

Long-time lurker here. Like many of you, I struggled with reaching for my phone first thing every morning. I tried:
- Leaving my phone in another room (just got up to get it)
- App timers (just dismissed them)
- Greyscale mode (didn't help)
- Deleting apps (reinstalled within days)

So I built something different: an app that blocks social media apps until you write a short journal entry (50 words by default).

The idea is simple: don't fight the urge to grab your phone. Just redirect what happens when you do.

Key features:
- Blocks any apps you choose during your "morning window"
- Unlocks everything once you write your required words
- All data encrypted locally—nothing leaves your device
- Two modes: Full Block or Gentle Reminder

I've been using it for months and have journaled more than in the previous 5 years combined.

Free on Google Play (no ads in the journal, just a banner on the home screen): [link]

Would love feedback from this community. What would make this more useful for you?
```

**r/productivity:**
```
Title: Replaced my morning doom-scrolling with journaling using a system (not willpower)

The problem: I'd grab my phone, "just check" Instagram, and lose 30-45 mins before getting out of bed.

The solution I built: An app that blocks social apps until I write 50 words.

Why it works:
1. No willpower needed at 6am—the app handles it
2. 50 words takes 2-3 minutes max
3. After journaling, apps unlock for the whole day
4. I've now built a journaling habit I never could before

After months of use, I'm sharing it publicly. Free on Google Play: [link]

Anyone else struggle with this? What's worked for you?

**r/Android:**
```
Title: [DEV] Morning Mindful - Block apps until you journal (privacy-focused, no account needed)

Hey r/Android,

I built an app to solve my own morning doom-scrolling problem and wanted to share it.

**What it does:**
Blocks apps you choose (Instagram, TikTok, etc.) during morning hours until you write a short journal entry.

**Privacy approach:**
- All data encrypted with AES-256
- Stored locally only—nothing leaves your device
- No account required
- Open to feedback on permissions (uses Accessibility Service for full-block mode, Usage Stats for gentle mode)

**Tech stack:** Kotlin, Room, Hilt, SQLCipher

Free with a banner ad on the home screen. No ads in the journal itself.

Play Store: [link]

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!
