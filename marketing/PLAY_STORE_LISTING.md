## Full Description (4000 characters max)

```
🌅 Take back your mornings. Stop doom-scrolling. Start journaling.

Morning Mindful helps you build a healthier relationship with your phone by blocking distracting apps until you write a short journal entry. It's simple: journal first, then social media.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ HOW IT WORKS

1️⃣ Set your morning window (e.g., 5 AM - 10 AM)
2️⃣ Choose which apps to block (Instagram, TikTok, X, etc.)
3️⃣ When you open a blocked app, you're prompted to journal
4️⃣ Write your required words (default: 50 words)
5️⃣ Apps unlock for the rest of the day

It's that simple. No willpower needed—just a gentle system that works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛡️ TWO BLOCKING MODES

• Full Block Mode - Instantly redirects you to journal when opening blocked apps
• Gentle Reminder Mode - Shows a dismissible overlay (for when you need flexibility)

You're always in control. Disable blocking anytime in settings.
