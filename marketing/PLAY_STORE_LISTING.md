## Full Description (4000 characters max)

```
🌅 You grab your phone. Open Instagram. An hour vanishes. Sound familiar?

Morning Mindful blocks your distracting apps until you write a short journal entry. That's the whole idea — journal first, then scroll.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ HOW IT WORKS

1️⃣ Set your morning window (e.g., 5 AM - 10 AM)
2️⃣ Choose which apps to block (Instagram, TikTok, X, etc.)
3️⃣ When you open a blocked app, you're prompted to journal
4️⃣ Write your required words (default: 50 words)
5️⃣ Apps unlock for the rest of the day

That's it. The app does the hard part so you don't have to white-knuckle it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛡️ TWO BLOCKING MODES

• Full Block Mode - Instantly redirects you to journal when opening blocked apps
• Gentle Reminder Mode - Shows a dismissible overlay (for when you need flexibility)

You're always in control. Disable blocking anytime in settings.

💭 WHY MORNING MINDFUL?

Be honest — what's the first thing you do every morning? For most of us, it's grab the phone and scroll. That sets the tone for the whole day, and usually not in a good way.

Morning Mindful puts a small speed bump between you and your apps. Before you scroll, you write. 50 words. That's all it takes to start your morning on your own terms instead of the algorithm's.

What people notice after a few weeks:
• Less morning anxiety
• Better focus throughout the day
• A journal that actually gets used
• The doom-scroll habit finally losing its grip

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 PERFECT FOR

• Anyone tired of Screen Time limits that don't actually work
• People who want to journal but can't stay consistent
• The "I'll just check one thing" crowd (we've all been there)
• Anyone who wants their mornings back

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Try it tomorrow morning. See what happens when you write before you scroll.
