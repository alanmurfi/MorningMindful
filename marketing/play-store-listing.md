## Full Description (4000 chars max)

**Break the doom-scrolling habit. Start every morning with intention.**

Morning Mindful blocks distracting apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit until you write a short journal entry. It's the simplest way to replace reactive scrolling with a few minutes of reflection.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Set your morning hours (e.g., 5 AM to 10 AM)
2. Open a blocked app and you're redirected to journal
3. Write your required word count (50-500 words, your choice)
4. All apps unlock for the rest of the day

That's it. No complicated setup, no subscriptions, no accounts.

**TWO BLOCKING MODES**

Choose the approach that works for you:

- Full Block: Instantly redirects you to journal. No way around it until you write.
- Gentle Reminder: Shows a friendly nudge. You can dismiss it or choose to write.

**YOUR JOURNAL, YOUR PRIVACY**

Every entry is encrypted with AES-256 (the same standard banks use) and stored only on your device. We never see, collect, or transmit your writing. No account required. No cloud sync. Your thoughts stay yours.

**FEATURES**

- Photo attachments with timeline view
- Mood tracking with each entry
- Streak tracking and word count stats
- Search through your journal history
- Daily reminder notifications
- Auto-save while you write
- Auto-backup with encrypted restore
- Material You dynamic colors (Android 12+)
- Dark mode support
- 3 languages: English, German, Chinese

**ALWAYS IN CONTROL**

- Disable blocking anytime from Settings
- Set your own timer (5-60 minutes)
- Customize which apps are blocked
- Works only during your chosen morning hours

**BUILT FOR TRUST**

Morning Mindful is open source on GitHub. The Accessibility Service only detects which app is in the foreground - it never reads content from other apps. See our full privacy policy for details.

Start tomorrow morning. Write a few words, unlock your day, and see how different it feels.
