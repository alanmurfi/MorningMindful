### Template 1: Initial Pitch to Tech Blogs

**Subject:** New Android App Tackles Morning Doom-Scrolling with a Twist

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I recently built an Android app that takes a different approach to digital wellness—one that doesn't rely on willpower.

**Morning Mindful** blocks social media apps until you write a short journal entry (just 50 words). Instead of fighting the urge to grab your phone first thing in the morning, it redirects that impulse into something beneficial.

**Key differentiators:**
- Privacy-first: AES-256 encryption, all data stored locally, no account required
- Two modes: Full Block or Gentle Reminder
- Built because I needed it myself (and it actually worked)

The app just entered open testing on Google Play and is preparing for full release.

Would you be interested in checking it out? I'm happy to provide:
- Early access
- Press kit with screenshots and assets
- Interview about the development process

Here's the Play Store link: [link]

Thanks for your time!

No worries if it's not a fit for your coverage right now.

Best,

### Template 3: Podcast Pitch

**Subject:** Podcast Guest Pitch: Building a Digital Wellness App (The "Anti-Willpower" Approach)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm a fan of [Podcast Name] and particularly enjoyed your episode about [specific episode].

I recently built an app called Morning Mindful that takes a counterintuitive approach to reducing screen time: instead of relying on willpower, it creates a "beneficial friction" by blocking social media until you write a short journal entry.

I'd love to share the story on your show. Some angles we could explore:

1. **Why willpower fails at 6am** - The psychology of morning habits
2. **Privacy-first development** - Why your journal shouldn't live in the cloud
3. **Building in public** - The indie developer journey from idea to Play Store
4. **The 50-word habit** - How micro-journaling builds consistency

A bit about me: I'm an independent developer who built this app to solve my own doom-scrolling problem. After months of personal use, I've journaled more than in the previous five years combined.

Would this be a good fit for your show?

Best,
Alan Murphy

### Template 7: Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:** Journal before you scroll. Block social media until you write.

**Description:**
Morning Mindful blocks your social apps until you write a short journal entry (50 words by default).

**The problem:** 80% of us grab our phones within minutes of waking up, often doom-scrolling before we even get out of bed.

**The solution:** Instead of fighting willpower, Morning Mindful redirects the impulse. Try to open Instagram? You'll be prompted to journal first. Takes 2-3 minutes, then everything unlocks.

**Privacy-first:**
- AES-256 encryption
- All data stored locally
- No account required
- No cloud, no sync, no way for anyone to read your thoughts

**Built by an indie dev** who needed this himself. After months of use, I've journaled more than in the previous 5 years combined.

**First Comment (as maker):**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Morning Mindful because every "digital detox" app I tried required willpower I didn't have at 6am.

My approach: don't fight the urge to grab your phone—just redirect what happens when you do.

Would love your feedback. What would make this more useful for you?
